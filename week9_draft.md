## Introduction

- Relational databases follow a schema, a detailed blueprint of how your tables work.

- NoSQL databases do not follow all the rules of a relational database â€”specifically, it does use a traditional row/column/table database design and does not use structured query language (SQL) to query data. **No stands for**, not only sql, it does not mean not sql. 

- There are four types of nosql-databases: (Document-based, Column-based, Graph-based, Examples of NoSQL databases)

- In this unit, we are going to be using  Cloud Firestore, a document-based no-sql database
